# InterLink: Bridging the Gap between Students and Internships

## Problem Statement

**The Challenge:** Accessible internship opportunities are severely lacking for students in Rwanda, especially high school and undergraduate students. This scarcity of suitable internships hampers their ability to secure future employment, as they lack vital experience, thereby undermining their career prospects. The absence of hands-on learning experiences further compounds this issue.

## Background

Unemployment in Rwanda is a pressing concern, with a staggering 52% of graduates currently unable to find jobs. This is largely attributed to the difficulty in obtaining internships and practical work experience, pivotal for transitioning into full-time employment. Despite ongoing efforts by government and non-governmental entities, the paucity of available internships and work experience programs persists as a significant barrier. This predicament hinders aspiring job market entrants from acquiring the skills and experience desired by employers. To tackle this issue effectively, targeted interventions are required, including improved access to skills development programs, and increased support for job placement and entrepreneurial opportunities.

## Target Audiences

Our project primarily focuses on high school and undergraduate students in Rwanda who struggle to secure employment due to limited access to internships. This directly impedes their capacity to acquire essential skills and experience for future career prospects. Furthermore, government institutions, non-governmental organizations, and private companies are essential stakeholders. Collaborating with these entities, InterLink seeks to create a mutually beneficial ecosystem where students can access meaningful internships, while organizations can tap into the fresh insights and contributions students offer.

## Proposed Solution and Uniqueness

**InterLink:** This innovative online internship system aims to address the challenges associated with finding suitable internships and companies willing to offer intern positions in Rwanda. InterLink is a web application that links students and companies, presenting an extensive database of internship opportunities spanning various sectors. Our solution centralizes these internships, aggregating links from diverse sources into one convenient platform. This simplifies the search process for students who often struggle to identify where internships are available.

InterLink's distinctive feature is its tailored matching algorithm, which recommends internships based on students' profiles and companies' prerequisites. This approach enhances alignment between students and internships, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful placements. Additionally, InterLink actively collaborates with companies to ensure a consistent influx of internship opportunities. By fostering these partnerships, we address the issue of limited availability by engaging organizations willing to provide valuable internships. Through these partnerships, we also plan to offer practical learning resources like workshops and skill development courses, enhancing students' learning experience during internships.

With its user-friendly interface, InterLink empowers students by bridging the gap between them and companies, augmenting their chances of securing employment and advancing their career trajectories. By addressing the core challenges of internship search, centralizing resources, and cultivating robust partnerships with organizations, InterLink aspires to make a positive impact on students' employability and overall career progression in Rwanda.
